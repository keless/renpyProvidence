    "Can one story change your life so forcefully that you no longer know who you are? That you are forced to throw off the shackles of \“society\” and \“decency\” that have been ingrained in you since you were a young boy?"
    "Can it reach its dark fingertips into the back of your head, feeling at first like cold sharp icicles that threaten your sanity, but turn slowly into warm fingers, tendrils, that massage your grey matter: shape and mold it, into something new.."
    "..something different? \ {w}Yes. {w}It can."

    "I’ve read such a story, and it did to me what this will do to you. {w=1}Even as you read these words, on paper or by the glow of a screen, somewhere behind you the darkness lurks."
    "And that darkness is observing you, waiting with baited breath; eagerly!"
    "Don’t bother with the lights-- the brighter they are, the greater the shadow they will cast."
    
    "That is the fundamental lesson here; your nonsensical notions of Right and Wrong, your idea that Good will always “win” in the end, that it will banish Evil."
    "That there IS a Good and an Evil."
    "That there is a correct way to live your life, and that it matters. Oh, the audacity! The sheer, incomprehensible {b}naivete{/b}."
    
    "You think I mock you, but I do not. I too was like you, my understanding of “reality” was as limited as yours. I received the same explanations of the world and the people in it; from Church, the Television, from Teachers, and Parents."
    "It was a set-up, a facade. Like Santa Claus; a lie to make the world more palatable for a growing consciousness. It served its purpose, brought me into adulthood in a seemingly functional manner; but it also became a crutch."
    "When I saw the reports of the latest major disaster, earthquake in Haiti, tidal waves in the Philippines, hurricane over the Mississippi-- such devastation. {w}How could a “God” {i}let{/i} that-- no, {w=0.5}{b}MAKE{/b} that happen."
    
    "But now I see with new eyes. I can see past the human suffering, because I am no longer shackled by Compassion. Now I appreciate the sheer force of such an event. The naked power that moves megatonnes of particles --pieces of reality!-- to do its bidding."
    "I understand it, I accept it. {w}You will too."
    
    "Do you think this is gibberish? Do you think I am insane?"
    
    "Let me ask you something. {w}What is sanity; what makes someone insane?"
    "Common knowledge says, “The definition of insanity is doing something over and over expecting different results.” Perhaps you’ve heard this before?"
    "It’s complete crap. {w}Would you call someone who tries to crack a walnut insane if it takes them more than two tries? {w}Of course not."

    #begin Page 2
    "No, in practice “sanity” is a made up term for how well a person integrates himself into society."
    "If a man eats another man’s brain in urban America, he is clearly insane. {w}But if that very same man eats another man’s brain in Papua New Guinea, he is doing honor to his dead tribesman. {w}Not convinced?"

    "Let’s say I take a small sharp object and insert it into your skin, {w}forcefully cutting through the first layer (the epidermis), {w}further into the dermis (rupturing small veins, causing blood vessels to blossom forth like carnations), {w}and deeper still into the subcutis-- that layer of fat and collagen just above your organs and muscle tissue."
    "I then pry the cut open, and behold the glorious work of nature within; {w}the warm, {w=1}wet, {w=1}pulsing {i}life{/i} within."
    
    "At this point-- am I sane? {w}Can you tell? {w}Do you have enough information? {w=1}No!"
    "“Perhaps you are a Doctor,” you think to yourself. “After all, you’re using medical terms like ‘epidermis’ and ‘subcutis’.. big words that most people don’t use.”"
    
    "But that’s what the Internet is for! {w}I could have just looked them up, never having gone to medical school. But does it matter if I’m a trained professional? {w}What is my motivation for opening you up, that’s the question you should really ask yourself."
    "Not {b}what{/b} is he, but {b}why{/b} is he."

    "I could be a doctor, but would that mean I was sane? {w}Ever heard of Zarkin? Dr. Alan Zarkin, look him up. {w}This trained medical professional, this trusted technician of stature delivered many lives into the world. He was an obstetrician."
    "And on September 7th, 1999, he successfully delivered a baby girl by Cesarean section. {w}He did such a wonderful job that, with several other medical professionals looking on, {i}he carved his initials into the stomach of the mother{/i}."
    
    "Let’s let that one sink in. {w}Three inches high: {b}A. Z.{/b}"

    "The other people in the room did not stop him. {w}In the proceeding days, many of his colleagues visited the woman and looked under her bandages to admire his work. None of them told her why. It was not until she asked for a hand mirror that she learned she had been mutilated by her caregiver."
    "After the heat of a public lawsuit, {i}not of their own volition{/i}, he was let go from that hospital, but found another that let him keep practicing. And he got paid to do this."  
    
    "Of course you think he is insane. But what do you think of his colleagues who clapped him on the back when he walked out of that surgery room? What do you think of the hospital that gave him a job when the first was forced to shun him due to bad publicity?"
     
    "What do you think that they thought about him?"

    "Ah, now you begin to see."

    "You see just how malleable terms like Right and Wrong can be. {w}And in the end, what happened?"
    
    #begin Page 3
    "The mother was given a child, and a scar. {w}It’s not the scar that caused her grief, Cesarean sections routinely leave a scar. {w}It was the shape of the scar, what it represented. {b}A. Z.{/b}"

    "Zarkin."
    
    "Zarkin tells us that Insanity, like Beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. And that is a terrible realization. {w}Do you feel the fingers in your head yet?"

    "I told you I read a story that helped bring me to this understanding. That isn’t entirely true, nor is it entirely false; again, that’s the point-- nothing is. {w}But I’m getting ahead of myself."

    "There was a book, {w}and a dream, {w}and an.. {w=1}incident. {w}Let’s start with the book."
    
    "It was a conspicuous Saturday morning when I came across it; conspicuous firstly because I was awake and out of my home at 8 in the morning-- normally I’m asleep until noon on the weekends, but for some reason I was driven, and driving, that morning."
    
    "Cruising down a boulevard that was eerily devoid of traffic, I came upon a malfunctioning street light. It wasn’t blinking red, it was just off. {w}Dead. {w}After waiting a minute I realized, with no traffic, I could just do as I pleased and I was cruising again, but not for long."

    "A couple of blocks down, my engine suddenly gave out. Dead as the traffic light. I coasted to a stop in an empty street space and tried to restart, but nothing-- not even the sound of the engine turning over (that “whrr whrr” sound you normally hear when your battery is dead and you turn the key)." 
    "Just the mechanical click, click, click of the ignition."

    "I pulled out my cellphone, becoming flustered. Tapping the screen.. surprise surprise, nothing happened. It was as if I had entered a world where nothing electrical worked. I looked around the empty street incredulously... and noticed there was one thing that worked."
    "A glowing neon “Open” sign in the window of a book store. I got out of the car and slammed the door, marching in the direction of the sign."

    "A bell rang as I entered the store, but the gentleman behind the counter didn’t respond. He was talking to another old man behind the counter who looked like a war vet: as indicated by the pins in his hat, and a missing arm with sleeve folded and pinned up."

    "I cleared my throat, “May I borrow your phone, I need to call a tow truck.” The first geezer was obliged to turn around long enough to nod in the direction of the phone next to the cash register and went back to his conversation."
    "I picked up the phone and realized: I didn’t know what number to call. Fortunately, the ancient man had a Yellow Pages directory next to the phone-- I remembered what cavemen did before smart phones and managed to call a tow service."

    #begin Page 4
    "“One hour,” they said. In the middle of the city, and it takes them an hour? I decided to wander about the store, the owner seemingly not caring that I existed at all much less in his store. It was during this time that I found it, or it found me. No, in retrospect I {i}know{/i}; it {b}chose{/b} me."
    
    "It was a book, a real, actual, honest, made-of-paper book. It wasn’t anything so pretentious as the Necronomicon-- no, but it was {i}portentous{/i}."
    
    "I cannot tell you the name of the book, no title graced its bindings. I can tell you it was old, but not ancient. Handwritten in pen and ink, but I’d have to surmise some time after Guttenberg had graced the world with the printing press (that is, approximately 1440 AD)."
    "So clearly this was a work of determination and care, perhaps aimed at sharing knowledge with the chosen few instead of the unwashed masses. Though, my opinion may be biased, as I was chosen to read it."
    
    "{b}Chosen.{/b} By whom, you ask, and why? We’ll get there, but you’re on the right track! Yes."

    "It was an old book, with no name as I have said, written in a curious script. With diagrams even more curious. Present were many familiar sigils from various faiths and secret societies."
    "I recognized the Compass, the Eye of Providence, the Borromean Rings. The Ankh, pinecone, Man as Universe, the Devil’s Trap, crescent moon, various astrological signs, many Magical circles. The seals of the Seven Angels, and signatures of Seven Demons."
    
    "And it had some.. {w=1}pictures of.. {w=1}things. {w=1}Creatures. {w=1}Beasts of myth and pure imagination, impossibly built, poorly rendered, and entirely maleficent. The stuff of nightmares."
    
    "The script seemed to describe each of these; where they originated, and whether they were real. At least, that’s what I decided when I first browsed the pages, since I could not actually read the words."
    "I tried to deduce meaning from their relation to the symbols, and the overall content of the book; a large group of seemingly amalgamated knowledge from disparate times and locales. It had to be a compendium of Occult knowledges."
    
    "I was still in the back of this little bookstore off Santa Monica boulevard when I perused the tome thusly. I’d have placed it back, but there was something about it that caused me to keep it in hand."
    "Probably the idea that, lacking a title, once I put it back on that shelf I would never be able to access it again. Being so used to the ability to conjure information in the blink of an eye: it irked me."

    "So it was that I carried the book to the oblivious old man at the front desk, who seemed more interested in talking to his fellow senior citizen chum behind the counter than to ring me up."
    "But at my incessant stare he was prompted to shut up and come remove the tacky orange sticker from the corner of my prize (I winced as it left an unsightly circle of discoloration and gooey residue) and take my money."
    "I could smell him as he handed me the book-- the smell of musk and decay, not otherworldly mind you, just the odor of an old man. An important distinction that will help you some day."

    #begin Page 5
    "You see, I didn’t know it at the time, but the book also had a smell. And this smell {b}was{/b} otherworldly. I smelled it in my sleep. I smelled it in my dreams-- no, my Dream. THE Dream."
    
    "the DREAM!?"

    "--in the DREAM is where it READ to ME. to ME it READ. it was RED. it MADE ME READ RED. it READ ME. it--"
    
    "Woah, okay look. That happened. I wrote that. And I’m not going to delete it, just so you think I’m sane. This is what I’m trying to explain to you. It makes sense to me; when you’re in the right time it will make sense to you."
    "You’re not here yet, but you’re on your way. Just remember Zarkin. It’s coming."
    
    "It."
    
    "I refer the book as It. It is not it, It is It. Capitol ‘I’. It has a personality, as I would come to find out."
    
    "You’re not here with me yet, so you’re just brushing that off as crazy talk. That’s fine. That’s okay. But look, let me explain something to you."
    "People treat things like people, and people like things."
    
    "Hmm, maybe that was too dense. Or maybe you’re too dense. No offense! Wait. I’ll explain it better, just give me a second."
    
    "Okay, have you ever watched a child with their favorite toy? Maybe its a stuffed rabbit, or a dolly, or maybe its not even shaped like an animate object, maybe it’s a dump truck."
    "But they have a special name for it, and “It” has a special place where It belongs and It “likes” to go to the sandbox or It likes to have macaroni and cheese for dinner. And It sits at the table with him. And he whispers to It. And that’s perfectly normal!"

    "But then he grows up and finds out that Humans have the assumption that other Humans are Humans, and therefore intelligent beings just like them."
    "And things that aren’t Humans are {i}Less Than{/i}. And they can’t have feelings like we do, because they never interact with us the way we expect other Humans to."
    "And some Humans aren’t Humans, but humans, and are also {i}Less Than{/i}."
    
    "Some Humans don’t even think animals have feelings."
    "But some people think animals are more real that Humans, and attribute more compassion and intellect to them than they deserve."
    "I’m losing you.. okay, wait for it. It’s coming."
    
    #being Page 6
    "Have you noticed how humans can treat some humans like objects? The guy you buy your coffee from, or your happy meal-- is just a food dispenser. You don’t care how his day is, or what it says on his name tag, you just want your service or your product, so you can be about your way."
    "Men treat women like objects all the time, and probably vice versa. I don’t know, I’m not a woman, what do you want from me? But you get my point, right?"

    "Humans treat Humans like Objects, and sometimes they treat Objects like Humans."

    "People treat things like people, and people like things."

    "Yes. Now you have it. You’re coming along just fine. {i}Ia, Ia, Yog-Sothoth!{/i}"

    "Oops. Too soon. Just ignore that."
    
    "So I’ve told you about the book. I picked it up expecting to place it in my own collection and gather dust there, perhaps never to open it again. But that same night, I had a dream."

    "Isn’t it funny; when you want something from a deity, you pray and pray for it to happen, and nothing ever does. But when it wants something from you, boy.. Well, I had a dream."

    "Before I tell you my dream, I have to explain something to you. It pains me to write this in words you will understand. The dream was not of this world, so using words made of, from, and for this world are inadequate to accurately describe what I witnessed."
    "It must be what John felt when he wrote the Book of Revelation. Though unlike the Apostle I was not commanded to share this dream; I do so at my own risk."
    
    "How to start? Imagine the color black. Not black like pigment on an object, which means that object is absorbing all the visible bands of light and reflecting none back into your eyes; black like the cold vastness of space. Black like void. Emptiness. Absence. Yes, that is a good start."

    "Now, in this cold black vacuum, something blacker still exists. Something huge. Something vast and cold and dark-- like space itself, but when thought about causes your brain to shudder uncontrollably, painfully, and you can think of nothing else, but there is nothing to think about because all that you can understand about it is that it is dark." 
    "Dark and intelligent. {w}And.. {w=1}Evil."
    
    "Again, my words aren’t doing justice. Did you ever see Fifth Element? You know the Dark Star that is approaching to destroy the universe, and Gary Oldman is on the phone with it. And he’s trying to broker a deal with it, and he’s sweating blood."
    "Like that, but not on a movie screen. It’s in your head."
    
    #begin Page 7
    "And you know, beyond doubt, that this thing existed before the universe was created, and it will exist after the universe ends. You know this, because to perceive it is to perceive its very nature, which is so very basic and primal that every fibre of your being screams at you to run."
    "To perceive it is to understand something, and in its understanding bring it forth into the world as it grasps a foothold inside of the mind of another conscious being. And the {i}horror{/i} of realizing that you have inadvertently helped this thing..."

    "But this is a dream, and you have no body, and you cannot run. You can only witness the visions play out before you. So this thing exists, and it brings forth two more things. Only they have names, and forms."
    
    "And you know their names, because the chanting tells you-- Ia, Ia; {i}Shub-Niggurath!{/i} Ia, Ia; {i}Yog-Sothoth!{/i} {b}Ia! Ia!{/b}"
    
    "And you see their forms in your mind. Hideous and otherworldly. Not right. Wrong. Blasphemous."

    "I told you before there was no Right and Wrong. Well that was then. You’re closer to me now, you can understand more, so understand this: Anything that is of this world is Right. Anything that is not is Wrong."
    
    "The being that spawned these two things are the most Wrong that a being can be."
    
    "In my Dream, the first of the two: Shub-Niggurath, is a large white worm. It has legs like a spider, rows of eyes on one fat side that ends in a giant beak. And like a termite queen, it constantly spawns monsters from the other side."

    "Ia, Ia; {i}Shub-Niggurath!{/i}"
    
    "But as disgusting as Shub-Niggurath is, Yog-Sothoth is not. One could almost describe it as beautiful. A swirling mass of glowing orbs. An almost purely Geometric being. But where Niggurath is awful in form, Sothoth is terrible by its very existence."
    "One can look upon the writhing form of the first being and think, “That is a thing that exists. I am afraid of it, and even though I have seen no creature like it, it is almost not Wrong, and I can believe it exists.” But to perceive Yog-Sothoth is like unto the nameless thing that spawned it."
    "It should not exist. It exists outside of Time and Space. It is here, and there, and not here nor there. And to perceive it is to know that it perceives you. {i}And that scares me so much you will never know unless you too have the misfortune to witness it firsthand.{/i}"

    "Ia, Ia; {i}Yog-Sothoth!{/i}"
    
    "And Shub-Niggurath lived on planet Earth. And Yog-Sothoth came down from the sky and they mated and produced two more beings: Yug and Neb, who were like their Mother the Great Worm: almost not Wrong."
    
    "{b}Ia! Ia!{/b}"
    
    #begin Page 8
    "And from Neb came The Dread One. Or maybe it was The Dead One. Or perhaps The Great Dreaded Dead One. And this being is what caused my mind to tear itself into pieces trying not to exist in the same understanding as It. {i}It.{/i} {b}It!{/b}"

    "{i}Ph’nglui Mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!{/i}"
    
    "And It is terrible, but then time passes and It dies. But what can be called dead which dies and yet dreams. For it rests still, in some forgotten city, sunken to the bottom of the vast Ocean."
    
    "Then as Humans came into existence they inherited Earth, and Yog-Sothoth opened a door and all of its children left the world of Humans. But he closed the door and locked it."
    "And when he locked it, he winked (this mass of glowing spheres winked at me!) and said, “Now is your time. But your time shall be measured.”"
    
    "{b}Zarkin.{/b}"
    
    "And I awoke. Blissfully I opened my eyes wide in the pitch black of night, welcoming the brilliant light of not-nothing, the warm caress of existence. So elated was I, that I was able to forget the dream for a day and a night. "
    
    "With a new zest for life I began a new work week. I hailed my coworkers heartily. I used elbow grease. I put my nose to the grindstone. I got things done. And it was all, so laughably inconsequential. So infinitesimally insignificant."
    "Once your consciousness is stretched to the size of the universe, how can you ever be satisfied with Mundania again?"
    
    "That second night I did not dream. But in the morning, I woke up with one thing on my mind. The book, Its smell, called to me. I got up from my mattress, walked barefooted across my flat to the bookshelf."
    "I clumsily pushed books out of the way, some falling to the floor unnoticed, searching for the book. The Book. I almost panicked when I could not find it anywhere on the shelves, but the scent came to me. It made me shiver in the cold morning air."

    "And I turned around. And It was there."
    
    "Waiting for me on my desk It sat. And I walked to it, and I could comprehend the blank cover. It wasn’t missing a title, emptiness was the title. And I opened it. And I could read it. And I was frightened by my realization."
    "But I couldn’t close the book, because as soon as I did I knew the Dream would come again."
    
    #begin Page 9
    "So I read the strange script once more. Clearly now, I understood it was written by Human hand but with a borrowed language that was older than humanity. I was able to read the preface; it seemed to have been written by a Prof. Derleth of the Miskatonic University."
    "He (or she?) writes that the contents of this tome was written at the request of a colleague and not meant for public distribution."
    "“The knowledge within is beholden to the terrible enlightenment of the existence of those ever-present never-seen beings known to some as the Deep Ones, denizens of the deep, waiters, watchers, plotters. Such is the language, or so I believe, as this book is written in.”" 
    "“And with their knowledge comes awareness of other beings, powers, and truths of Majik contained herein.”"

    "Many of the creatures were straight out of mythology; the satyr, dryad, pegasus, the Egyptian gods. And others were strange, frog-like, fish-like, chimeric, some so deformed the closest I could compare them to would be the strangest thing I knew: Shub-Niggurath."
    
    "{i}Ia! The Black Goat of the Woods, with a Thousand Young.{/i}"
    
    "Even waking, the chanting reaches me when I am reading It. But I keep on reading."
    "The section on sigils and Magic Circles proved insightful; “Nothing within the inscriptions themselves is powerful,” wrote Derleth." 
    "“But by performing the rights, a sort of placebo effect is achieved, relaxing the mind and guarding it against thoughts of the dark ones; shutting them off from access to the practitioner's consciousness.” Perhaps I’ll try this myself, I think."

    "I remember searching the book for the beings witnessed in my Dream, but no mention was made of any of them; Yug, Neb, Shub-Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth, nor the nameless darkness that spawned them. None, save one: Cthulhu. He was not named in my Dream, but I remember the name from the chanting."
    
    "{i}...Cthulhu...{/i}"
    
    "On the last fold of the book, the last page was dedicated in whole to an illustration of a being that could only be described as a giant, humanoid, squid-dragon-{i}thing{/i}, and I laughed and cried and screamed, all at the same time."
    
    "I laughed because this was the scrawling of a human hand childishly trying to reproduce the image of a god. I cried because the dark fingers at the back of my mind suddenly tensed, threatening to crush my existence into nothingness. And I screamed-- I screamed because it was the Right thing to do."
    
    "I did not read the written description on the page to the left of the illustration. I did not want to, and I did not need to. And I did not have time to."
    
    "Because the Dream came upon me again. Only it wasn’t a dream, unless it was a waking dream. A dream where I woke, and kept dreaming, but I was not waking from the dream, I was waking from reality and reality was {i}sleeping{/i} but I was {b}dreaming{/b}, which was the {i}real{/i} {b}reality{/b}."
    
    "-- in DREAMING the ENIGMA was IMAGED. READING the MIRAGE, I GAINED the IDEA to DARE, ANGER RAGED, the DIRE NAMED REIGN from the AGE of RIME. DIM. MAD. DIE. DIE. {b}DIE!{/b} the DEAR DREAM --"

    #begin Page 10
    "I woke up for the third time that day. To the smell. There is no describing it. It’s not “like” anything. It is its own smell, and I smelled it again. And I woke, and I looked down, and I saw the knife on the ground."
    "And I saw the black ichor covering my arms and my chest, and the thing in my hand that looked like a severed tentacle but with a hooked claw at the tip, and it twitched, and breathlessly I screamed and threw it across the room into the darkest corner where it belonged."

    "If I had cared to cross the room back to the book and search the pages, I’m sure I could have found the name of the creature it belonged to. But “what” does not matter. "
    
    "“Why,” I whimpered to no one. To myself. To {b}It{/b}. “Why did you chose me?” Alas, knowing the right question, still I do not know how to find the right answer."
    
    "But I managed to shamble my way back to the wall; with purpose I tore down a painting and two framed photos that hung there. Crying and shaking, I covered my index finger in the black ooze that was seeping into my skin, and I inked a circle on the wall."
    "I filled it in with the symbols I remembered seeing in the Book as closely as I could. I told myself, it is not the signs that have power, it is the ritual that prepares the mind to shroud itself in ignorance."
    
    "Ironic, that it is the absence of knowledge that protects one from the knowledge of that which should be absent. Ignorance is bliss, but ignorance can only be appreciated after it is lost."
    
    "Once the circle, no the rite, was completed my mind was at instantly at ease. The hooked tendril I had thrown in the corner only moments before was nowhere to be found.. The black ichor, even the circle was no longer visible to me. But I did not replace the pictures on the wall."
    
    "I retraced the empty space on the wall with my hand, recreating the lines in my mind. A large square encompassed by a circle; inside the symbols of the four corners of the Earth, with lines protruding from each of them like reindeer antlers or pine trees or antenna."
    "And in the center, the Eye surrounded by a Triangle. I knew {i}why{/i} I did this --for protection-- but delightfully I no longer know {i}what{/i} I needed to be protected from."
    
    "The Book had no name for the circle, only a subtitle that it was meant for protection against evil spirits. So I named it the Circle of Zarkin, and every day before I woke up and before I slept I would perform it in front of the wall above my headboard."
    
    "Sometimes I would hear the chanting, and realize it was me, so I would perform the Circle again and again until it stopped. And I always search the corners of my room with a broom now, and every socket has a night light, and every window is closed tight, and the knife is in the kitchen where it belongs."
    
    #begin Page 11
    "And as for It, I did not remember closing It, nor placing it back on the bookshelf. But that is how It sat day in and day out as I returned to my normal life. Occasionally, I could feel it humming and I would stand in front of the bookshelf and stroke Its spine reassuringly, and it would quiet down."
    
    "But soon enough, that was not enough. So I would pull it out and place it, closed, upon Its favorite spot on my desk, only to replace it again before I went to rest. And I did not Dream, nor did I even dream."

    "I once wrote an email to the University, hoping to get in contact with Professor Derleth, but I never received a response; possibly for the best."

    "And so, before you read this story, you might have thought I was crazy. But now you know, as I know, the real answer to the real question of Why. It makes sense to you as it does me, because you have enough information to judge. You are different than you were, you are with me now."
